# .github - Organization default templates

The files in this repository serve as defaults for the organization if files of the same name/role are not present in a 
given repository.

Each file is written as generically as possible, so that its text can apply to any project with minimal editing.

## How to use

### In this organization

Anywhere that a repo doesn't have a particular template .github file, the files in this repo will automatically help you 
out.
